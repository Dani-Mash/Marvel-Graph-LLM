  "start_type": "Gene",
  "relation_chain": ["CONFERS"],
  "target_type": "Power"
}
```

#### **Query Facts:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "plan": {
    "start_entity": "Regenerative Mutation",
    "start_type": "Gene",
    "relation_chain": ["CONFERS"],
    "target_type": "Power"
  },
  "results": ["Accelerated Healing", "Enhanced Senses"],
  "query_type": "Gene → Power"
}
```

### **LLM Response:**
```
The Regenerative Mutation gene confers two primary abilities: **Accelerated Healing** and **Enhanced Senses**.

**Accelerated Healing**: This power allows individuals with the Regenerative Mutation to recover from injuries at a significantly faster rate than normal humans. This ability can range from healing minor cuts and bruises in seconds to recovering from more severe injuries, such as broken bones or deep wounds, in a matter of minutes or hours. This rapid healing process not only aids in physical recovery but can also extend the individual's lifespan by slowing down the aging process.

**Enhanced Senses**: Individuals with this gene experience heightened sensory perception. This can include improved vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Enhanced senses allow the individual to detect subtle changes in their environment, perceive threats more quickly, and react with heightened awareness. This ability is particularly advantageous in combat situations or when navigating complex environments.

Together, these powers make those with the Regenerative Mutation highly resilient and perceptive, often giving them a significant advantage in both survival and combat scenarios.
```

### **Knowledge Graph Grounding:**
✅ **Facts Verified**: Both conferred powers (Accelerated Healing, Enhanced Senses) confirmed in knowledge graph  
✅ **Query Plan**: Correctly identifies gene → power relationship  
✅ **Results Accuracy**: Exactly matches graph data (2 powers conferred)  
✅ **Scientific Accuracy**: Response grounded in genetic mutation concept  
✅ **No Character Context**: Gene queries don't include character snippets (correct behavior)
